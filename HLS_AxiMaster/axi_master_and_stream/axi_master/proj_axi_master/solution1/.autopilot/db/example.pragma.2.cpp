/* These are defined by the user (or the compiler)
   to specify the desired environment:

   __STRICT_ANSI__	ISO Standard C.
   _ISOC99_SOURCE	Extensions to ISO C89 from ISO C99.
   _ISOC11_SOURCE	Extensions to ISO C99 from ISO C11.
   _POSIX_SOURCE	IEEE Std 1003.1.
   _POSIX_C_SOURCE	If ==1, like _POSIX_SOURCE; if >=2 add IEEE Std 1003.2;
			if >=199309L, add IEEE Std 1003.1b-1993;
			if >=199506L, add IEEE Std 1003.1c-1995;
			if >=200112L, all of IEEE 1003.1-2004
			if >=200809L, all of IEEE 1003.1-2008
   _XOPEN_SOURCE	Includes POSIX and XPG things.  Set to 500 if
			Single Unix conformance is wanted, to 600 for the
			sixth revision, to 700 for the seventh revision.
   _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED XPG things and X/Open Unix extensions.
   _LARGEFILE_SOURCE	Some more functions for correct standard I/O.
   _LARGEFILE64_SOURCE	Additional functionality from LFS for large files.
   _FILE_OFFSET_BITS=N	Select default filesystem interface.
   _BSD_SOURCE		ISO C, POSIX, and 4.3BSD things.
   _SVID_SOURCE		ISO C, POSIX, and SVID things.
   _ATFILE_SOURCE	Additional *at interfaces.
   _GNU_SOURCE		All of the above, plus GNU extensions.
   _DEFAULT_SOURCE	The default set of features (taking precedence over
			__STRICT_ANSI__).
   _REENTRANT		Select additionally reentrant object.
   _THREAD_SAFE		Same as _REENTRANT, often used by other systems.
   _FORTIFY_SOURCE	If set to numeric value > 0 additional security
			measures are defined, according to level.

   The `-ansi' switch to the GNU C compiler, and standards conformance
   options such as `-std=c99', define __STRICT_ANSI__.  If none of
   these are defined, or if _DEFAULT_SOURCE is defined, the default is
   to have _SVID_SOURCE, _BSD_SOURCE, and _POSIX_SOURCE set to one and
   _POSIX_C_SOURCE set to 200809L.  If more than one of these are
   defined, they accumulate.  For example __STRICT_ANSI__,
   _POSIX_SOURCE and _POSIX_C_SOURCE together give you ISO C, 1003.1,
   and 1003.2, but nothing else.

   These are defined by this file and are used by the
   header files to decide what to declare or define:

   __USE_ISOC11		Define ISO C11 things.
   __USE_ISOC99		Define ISO C99 things.
   __USE_ISOC95		Define ISO C90 AMD1 (C95) things.
   __USE_POSIX		Define IEEE Std 1003.1 things.
   __USE_POSIX2		Define IEEE Std 1003.2 things.
   __USE_POSIX199309	Define IEEE Std 1003.1, and .1b things.
   __USE_POSIX199506	Define IEEE Std 1003.1, .1b, .1c and .1i things.
   __USE_XOPEN		Define XPG things.
   __USE_XOPEN_EXTENDED	Define X/Open Unix things.
   __USE_UNIX98		Define Single Unix V2 things.
   __USE_XOPEN2K        Define XPG6 things.
   __USE_XOPEN2KXSI     Define XPG6 XSI things.
   __USE_XOPEN2K8       Define XPG7 things.
   __USE_XOPEN2K8XSI    Define XPG7 XSI things.
   __USE_LARGEFILE	Define correct standard I/O things.
   __USE_LARGEFILE64	Define LFS things with separate names.
   __USE_FILE_OFFSET64	Define 64bit interface as default.
   __USE_BSD		Define 4.3BSD things.
   __USE_SVID		Define SVID things.
   __USE_MISC		Define things common to BSD and System V Unix.
   __USE_ATFILE		Define *at interfaces and AT_* constants for them.
   __USE_GNU		Define GNU extensions.
   __USE_REENTRANT	Define reentrant/thread-safe *_r functions.
   __USE_FORTIFY_LEVEL	Additional security measures used, according to level.

   The macros `__GNU_LIBRARY__', `__GLIBC__', and `__GLIBC_MINOR__' are
   defined by this file unconditionally.  `__GNU_LIBRARY__' is provided
   only for compatibility.  All new code should use the other symbols
   to test for features.

   All macros listed above as possibly being defined by this file are
   explicitly undefined if they are not explicitly defined.
   Feature-test macros that are not defined by the user or compiler
   but are implied by the other feature-test macros defined (or by the
   lack of any definitions) are defined by the file.  */

/* The machine-dependent file <bits/typesizes.h> defines __*_T_TYPE
   macros for each of the OS types we define below.  The definitions
   of those macros must use the following macros for underlying types.
   We define __S<SIZE>_TYPE and __U<SIZE>_TYPE for the signed and unsigned
   variants of each of the following integer types on this machine.

	16		-- "natural" 16-bit type (always short)
	32		-- "natural" 32-bit type (always int)
	64		-- "natural" 64-bit type (long or long long)

	QUAD		-- 64-bit type, always long long
	WORD		-- natural type of __WORDSIZE bits (int or long)
	LONGWORD	-- type of __WORDSIZE bits, traditionally long

   We distinguish WORD/LONGWORD, 32/LONG32, and 64/QUAD so that the
   conventional uses of `long' or `long long' type modifiers match the
   types we define, even when a less-adorned type would be the same size.
   This matters for (somewhat) portably writing printf/scanf formats for
   these types, where using the appropriate l or ll format modifiers can
   make the typedefs and the formats match up across all GNU platforms.  If
   we used `long' when it's 64 bits where `long long' is expected, then the
   compiler would warn about the formats not matching the argument types,
   and the programmer changing them to shut up the compiler would break the
   program's portability.

   Here we assume what is presently the case in all the GCC configurations
   we support: long long is always 64 bits, long is always word/address size,
   and int is always 32 bits.  */
